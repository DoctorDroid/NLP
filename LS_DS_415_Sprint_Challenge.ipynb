    "After a week of Natural Language Processing, you've learned some cool new stuff: how to process text, how turn text into vectors, and how to model topics from documents. Apply your newly acquired skills to one of the most famous NLP datasets out there: [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge). As part of the job selection process, some of my friends have been asked to create analysis of this dataset, so I want to empower you to have a head start.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The real dataset is massive (almost 8 gigs uncompressed). I've sampled the data for you to something more managable for the Sprint Challenge. You can analyze the full dataset as a stretch goal or after the sprint challenge. As you work on the challenge, I suggest adding notes about your findings and things you want to analyze in the future.\n",

       " 'Recently my family of my wife two kids myself celebrated my wife s birthday at Via Brasil She had been there once before but this was the first visit for the rest of us I had trepidations from reading so many comments about how formal it was and how it was not good for children Both of those comments could not be farther from what we experienced When I made reservations online I clearly indicated that we would have two young children maybe just to see if the restaurant would give some indication of their reaction but within minutes I got a phone call to confirm the request and welcoming our children to dine with us At that time I also mentioned that it was my wife s birthday and they graciously said they would do something as a surprise Yes I know this is becoming perhaps an all too familiar perk for restaurants as well as many diners to have to hear Happy Birthday chanted several times during their meal The decor is upscale and suggests the kind of place with some snoot appeal where people may come to be seen but let s face it this is a suburban restaurant and what restaurant would risk alienating the down to earth folks with an overly haughty attitude these days Via Brasil gets it just right in that the hardware is upscale and formal but the staff and service is engaging and friendly without any pretentiousness whatsoever When we arrived I immediately noticed many parties with children although I couldn t help but note that they all seemed to be seated in the front section of the restaurant and that maybe the staff was consciously trying to keep the back part of the large open dining area somewhat kid free and quiet It didn t matter to us the entire dining room is beautiful and the food is the same regardless of what GPS cell your table is in As for the food I rated it stars and not just because there were some items that were not quite as superlative as others Everything happened as others have mentioned you sit for a short while order drinks and build up a little more anticipation but then it s a bee line to the buffet which had more variety than the average casino hotel buffet Salads soups and various hot dishes stroganoff a curry dish a risotto seafood paella etc along with appetizers that were presented well and tasted great carpaccio asparagus etc NOTE The captain had come over shortly after we were seated to let me know that our year old would be given a very reduced price for the entire meal around I think and she would be able to eat anything she wanted all meats etc and that our year old would not be charged at all While I don t know if that s their standard policy I felt that was more than fair and certainly goes a long way to encourage family dining at this restaurant from time to time The waitstaff was great in handling our children too always stopping at each one of them to see if they too wanted to try whatever cut of meat they were offering on each round Even as we were coming back with full plates of appetizers freshly grilled meats were being walked around the tables and the noshing if one can nosh on meats started right away Before we knew what hit us we had cuts and slices of so many different types of meats and most of it was excellent All of the beef offerings rib eye picanha flank steak garlic picanha and the prime rib we passed on the ribs because they were too huge and wouldn t fit on our plates at the time were fantastic My wife enjoyed the lamb chops immensely though I wish we had stuck around for the leg of lamb to make its rounds The other offerings turkey pork and salmon were a little hit or miss probably because I prefer my meats less garnished and these were typically crusted or sprinkled with parmesan or wrapped in bacon Actually I enjoyed the salmon though many may find its smoked flavoring a little washed out and bland and its texture a little pasty instead of flaky imagine cooked small roe The sausage didn t do anything for me but then again I m not a sausage fan Before we knew it almost hours had elapsed which is saying a lot when dining with children They had sampled quite a few meats too and while it may not become their favorite restaurant I think the bigness of the experience kept them from becoming restless and they both said they enjoyed VBS I m running out of room here so I ll just say LEAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT They also remembered my quick comment about my wife s birthday and delivered birthday wishes as requested Definitely a place to consider for all occasions but do plan on spending a good deal of time and money around for the entire experience even with the generous discounts for the kids and we aren t wine drinkers I hope this place stays around a while',\n",

       " 'Elephant Bar s decor creates a sort of trendier version of Applebee s if it were set in the jungle The service is very friendly and accomodating and that alone earns them a star The food on the other hand is just sort of blah No it wasn t necessarily bad it was just very bland My mom and I split the grilled shrimp salad don t remember what it was called but I think it was supposed to be Asian influenced and the catfish fillet with mango salsa The salad was pretty good but how can you really go wrong with grilled shrimp and salad The fish however was completely flavorless It was like they didn t bother to season it AT ALL no salt no pepper no nothing The only time my taste buds had anything to do at all was when I took a bite of fish with the mango salsa thank goodness for mango salsa The rice wasn t even good It was so dry and flavorless with each grain scattered across the plate trying to escape from one another I like my rice fluffy and soft with just enough moisture for all the grains to want to stick together To be fair I wasn t really expecting much from the food here so I can t say I was terribly disappointed Since I live in New York I probably won t ever return to Elephant Bar It s almost funny to me how memorably bland the food was Then again I should have known better because you can t spell bland without B A D',\n",
       " 'One of the hidden gems in Montreal s China town featuring delicious family style Hunan Sichuan style Chinese food The portions were very generous two soups and five dishes were plenty for a party of seven and the price was extremely reasonable for the quality of food offered One dish that stood out the sizzling lamb blew away all of our expectations and guarantees that we will make a return trip My only reason for giving four stars instead of five is due to the corn soup being very mediocre Other then that I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes spicy Chinese food',\n",

The red bar represents the frequency of the word within the topic, and the blue bar represents the overall frequency over the full set of topics. Also, hovering over any given word will adjust the circles to represent in which topics that word was found, and how often.  \n",
